# Claims Platform

A full-stack motor and property claims platform for six APAC markets, built for the Chubb APAC full-stack take-home
assessment. **One Angular application** serves claimants and claims staff, on top of **three Spring Boot services**
that communicate over **REST and Kafka**.

- **Claimants** report an incident, track their claim, answer information requests, upload documents and receive
  decisions.
- **Claims officers** pick up claims from an intake queue, review and assess them, and settle or reject them.
- **Managers** see team workload and performance, SLA breaches and outstanding liability exposure.

> **Quick start:** `docker compose up --build`, then open **http://localhost:8080** and sign in as a
> [demo user](#demo-users), for example `officer-1` / `Test@123`.

```

- The **frontend** talks to the backend only over **REST**, through one origin, so no CORS is needed.
- **Commands** (submit, assess, approve, and so on) go to `claims-service`, which answers immediately with the updated
  claim.
- Every change is published to **Kafka** through a transactional outbox. `reporting-service` and
  `notification-service` consume the events independently (eventually consistent, typically within a second).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Needed for |
|---|---|---|
| Docker Desktop | recent, at least 4 GB of memory | the one-command setup |
| JDK | 17 | running the services outside Docker |
| Node.js | 22 or newer | running the frontend outside Docker |

### Option 1: Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker compose up --build      # Postgres, Kafka, the three services and the web app
```

| URL | What |
|---|---|
| http://localhost:8080 | **Web application** |
| http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html | Claims API (Swagger UI) |
| http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html | Reporting API |
| http://localhost:8083/swagger-ui.html | Notification API |

### Option 2: Local development

```bash
docker compose up -d kafka                              # Kafka only
./gradlew :claims-service:bootRun                       # terminal 1 → :8081
./gradlew :reporting-service:bootRun                    # terminal 2 → :8082
./gradlew :notification-service:bootRun                 # terminal 3 → :8083
cd claims-web && npm ci && npm start                    # terminal 4 → http://localhost:4200
```

> Don't run Docker copies and local copies of the same service at the same time. They clash on ports and Kafka
> consumer groups.

Configuration, database, production build and troubleshooting: **[docs/developer-guide.md](docs/developer-guide.md)**

## Demo users

All demo users share the password **Test@123**. It is set as `app.security.demo-password` in each service's
`src/main/resources/application.yml`; to change it, edit it in all three. These are demo credentials for local
development and assessment only, not real secrets.

| Username | Role | Lands on |
|---|---|---|
| `tan@example.com`, `lee@example.com` | Claimant | My claims |
| `officer-1`, `officer-2` | Claims officer | Intake queue |
| `manager-1` | Claims manager | Dashboard |

**A two-minute tour:**
1. As `tan@example.com`, report an incident with a PDF attached and note the reference number.
2. As `officer-1`, pick the claim up from the intake queue, then request information.
3. As `tan@example.com`, answer the request (it's also under Notifications).
4. As `officer-1`, assess, approve and settle the claim.
5. As `manager-1`, open the Dashboard, Team performance and SLA breaches.

## Testing

```bash
./gradlew test                               # backend: unit, integration, embedded Kafka (+ JaCoCo)
cd claims-web
npm test                                     # frontend unit and component tests (Vitest)
npm run coverage                             # with coverage
npm run e2e                                  # end-to-end, against the running application
```

| Suite | Tests | Result | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Backend (JUnit, MockMvc, embedded Kafka) | 64 | ✅ all passed | instructions 95.5% / 97.6% / 96.9% per service |
| Frontend unit and component (Vitest) | 91 | ✅ all passed | statements 87%, lines 90% |
| End-to-end (Playwright: workflows, accessibility, mobile) | 37 | ✅ all passed (dev server and Docker) | – |
| API collection (newman) | 51 requests, 93 assertions | ✅ 0 failures | – |

## Assessment and AI-assisted development

- **Brief:** [assessment-brief/V2_FullStack_candidate_assessment_brief.docx](assessment-brief/V2_FullStack_candidate_assessment_brief.docx),
  with the [repository guidelines](assessment-brief/take-home-assessment-repository-guidelines.md).
- **Approach:** the backend first, as the brief advises, then the Angular frontend. How each part was built, the
  challenges met, and the key prompts: [docs/approach.md](docs/approach.md).
- **AI:** built with **Claude Code**. The prompts are in [prompts/](prompts/), and the
  [AI journal](ai-journal/claude-journal.md) records what was accepted, challenged and overridden, and why.
